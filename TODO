- load initial trains - sequence (multiple ajax requests) - keep track of vehicles in SESSION
--- maybe use the same approach for loading the routes
- restrict access to feed/tmp/sbb_export.db


- get rid of latlngFromString -> use coordinates, is faster
--- OR use encoded polylines
- if is not yet on the map, add it. Use station coordinates
